# (not) Responsive Portfolio
Wow, this repository is from my first week of coding and boy oh boy, I did not understand bootstrap or responsive design.  As I tell my students, don't hide your growth.  Allow your github repositories to show how far you have come as a developer.  In that spirit, I'm not editing this portfolio to demonstrate my skills today.  Please visit my react portfolio in my pinned respositories to see my current design and layout skills.
